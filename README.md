# Loan Default Prediction & Risk Analytics Platform

Welcome to the **Loan Default Prediction & Risk Analytics Platform**—an end-to-end, production-ready pipeline that ingests raw loan data, engineers sophisticated financial features, trains profit-optimised machine-learning models, and outputs human-readable risk intelligence for credit-decision teams.

> **Audience**  
> • Business stakeholders who need a high-level view of value delivered  
> • Data scientists & ML engineers who want to replicate or extend the work  
> • Non-technical users who just need to run the notebooks and see results

## 1  Quick Start (5 minutes)

```bash
# clone project
$ git clone https://github.com/your-handle/loan-risk-analytics.git && cd loan-risk-analytics

# create environment (conda or venv)
$ conda env create -f env.yml  # or python -m venv venv
$ conda activate loan-risk

# run Phase 1 notebook end-to-end
$ jupyter lab notebooks/01_basic_pipeline.ipynb
```
*Artifacts* will appear under `data/processed/` and `models/`.

## 2  Project Roadmap

| Phase | What it does | Key Files |
|-------|-------------|-----------|
| **1. Data Foundation** | Cleans raw CSVs, validates schema, builds baseline model | `notebooks/01_basic_pipeline.ipynb` |
| **2. Advanced Analytics** | 2.1 Feature Engineering → 2.2 Profit Optimisation → 2.3 Portfolio Intelligence → 2.4 Explainability | `notebooks/02_advanced_feature_engineering.ipynb` <br> `notebooks/03_business_cost_optimization.ipynb` <br> `notebooks/04_risk_segmentation_portfolio.ipynb` |
| **3. Deployment (OPTIONAL)** | Docker + FastAPI micro-service, CI/CD, monitoring | _future_ |
| **4. Documentation** | README (this), Technical Doc, Mathematical Doc | `docs/` |

## 6  Key Features Delivered

| Category | Highlights |
|----------|------------|
| **Financial Feature Engineering** | 57 domain-specific variables: payment-shock, debt-service-coverage, human-capital score, opportunity index, etc. |
| **Business-Cost Optimised ML** | LightGBM + cost-sensitive weights, profit-maximising threshold search. |
| **Portfolio Segmentation** | Seven segments (Premier → High-Touch) with bespoke pricing/approval rules. |
| **Explainability & Fairness** | Permutation importance, interpretable tree, bias checks, model card. |

---

## 7  Extending the Project

1. **Plug-in new data sources** – add CSVs to `data/raw`, adjust schema list in `01_basic_pipeline.ipynb`.
2. **Swap model** – change the estimator in `03_business_cost_optimization.ipynb` (e.g., XGBoost, CatBoost).
3. **Add real-time scoring** – follow the FastAPI template in the Technical Doc.
4. **Deploy to cloud** – build Docker image, push to AWS ECR, use ECS Fargate.
